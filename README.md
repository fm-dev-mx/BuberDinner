# ASP.NET 8 REST API Following CLEAN ARCHITECTURE & DDD

This repository contains the code for a YouTube tutorial series by Amichai Mantinband, where he builds a REST API following Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles using ASP.NET 6. However, the content of this repository has been adapted and implemented using the latest version, ASP.NET 8.

## Tutorial Series

The tutorial series covers the development of a REST API from scratch, following Clean Architecture and DDD best practices. It utilizes various technologies and libraries, including:

- .NET 8 (originally based on .NET 6)
- Entity Framework Core
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- MediatR
- FluentValidation
- ErrorOr
- Throw
- Mapster

The series aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these patterns and libraries, enabling you to apply them effectively in industry-level applications.
